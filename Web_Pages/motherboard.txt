<h1>mother board</h1>
<p>
A motherboard (sometimes alternatively known as the mainboard, system board, 
planar board or logic board,[1] or colloquially, a mobo) is a printed circuit board (PCB) 
found in all modern computers which holds many of the crucial components of the system, 
such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.
