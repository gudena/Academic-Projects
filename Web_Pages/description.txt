  <h1> PARTS OF A COMPUTER </h1>
  
  <h2>1.input</h2>
  
  <h3>1.1 keyboard</h3>
  <p>
  In computing, a keyboard is a 
  typewriter-style device, which uses an 
  arrangement of buttons or keys, to act as 
  mechanical levers or electronic switches.

  <h3>1.2 mouse</h3>
  <p>
  In computing, a mouse is a pointing device 
  that functions by detecting two-dimensional 
  motion relative to its supporting surface. 
  Physically, a mouse consists of an object 
  held under one of the user's hands, with one or more buttons.

  <h3>2.1 monitor</h3>
  <p>
  A monitor or a display (also called screen or visual display unit) 
  is an electronic visual display for computers. 
  The monitor comprises the display device, circuitry and an enclosure. 
  The display device in modern monitors is 
  typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) 
  thin panel, while older monitors use a cathode ray tube (CRT) 
  about as deep as the screen size.

  <h3>2.2 printer</h3>
  <p>
  In computing, a printer is a peripheral which produces a 
  representation of an electronic document on physical media 
  such as paper or transparency film. Many printers are local 
  peripherals connected directly to a nearby personal computer.

  <h2>3.processing elements</h2>
  
  <h3>3.1 RAM</h3>
  <p>
  Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage. 
  A random-access device allows stored data to be accessed in very 
  nearly the same amount of time for any storage location, so data 
  can be accessed quickly in any random order.

  <h3>3.2 mother board</h3>
  <p>
   A motherboard (sometimes alternatively known as the mainboard, system board, 
   planar board or logic board,[1] or colloquially, a mobo) is a printed circuit 
   board (PCB) found in all modern computers which holds many of the crucial components 
   of the system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) 
   and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.
