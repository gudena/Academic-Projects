<pre id="pr1" style="visibility:hidden" onClick="Display()">The iPhone 5 is a touchscreen-based smartphone developed by Apple Inc..
It is the sixth generation of the iPhone and succeeds the iPhone 4S. 
The phone is a slimmer, lighter model that introduces a higher-resolution,
4-inch screen to the series with 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio.
The phone also includes a custom-designed ARMv7 processor called the Apple A6, 
an update to Apple's mobile operating system known as iOS 6, and support for LTE.

Apple held an event to formally introduce the phone on September 12, 2012. 
Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012 and over two million were 
received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply 
available at launch on September 21, 2012, and has been described by Apple as 
"extraordinary", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. 
After the launch of the device, Samsung filed a lawsuit against Apple, 
claiming that the iPhone 5 infringes eight of its patents.</pre>
